## How to create my own pack?
#### How to create Texture pack?
If you want to create your own **pack of Textures**, you should create folder inside **images** and put your balls textures inside of it in **.png** format
#### How to create Sound pack to new Texture pack?
1. Create folder with **the same name** as Textures folder, but this time in **music** folder
2. Start putting your sounds in folder. Use **default** folder as an example
3. Notice, that acceptable format in audio effects is **wav** only, but background music can be mp3 as well
4. You dont have to create all sounds for pack. If something is missing, the game will automatically use default sound instead :)

## Current Status
Project development is slowed down, because I was bored of this App and Have not too much time right now to creating new updates.
